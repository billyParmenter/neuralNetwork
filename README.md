# neuralNetwork
A baseic neural network

The neuralNet.cs file contains classes for creating and using a Neural Network.
The NeuralNet class is initialized with an array of integers.
each integer is a layer and the value of the integer is the 
number of neurons that should be in the layer. I sugest having 
the last layer have a value of one, multiple outputs has not
been tested.

The netManager.cs file is used when training a population of neural networks. It
handles the creation of the next generation.
